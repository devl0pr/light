# Chapter 1: David Hunter

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's father, Thomas Hunter, was a prosecutor. Just a few days after sentencing the Italian mafia boss, Emanuel Gonzales, to 25 years in prison, he was killed outside the courthouse after work. Thomas’s wife had passed away years before, leaving him with only a son.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David was just 20 years old when he received the news. Losing his father after already losing his mother deepened the pain within him. His inner world was dark and desolate. His thoughts were chaotic, like an unending storm. The compass of his life showed no direction, spinning aimlessly like a whirlwind. Thoughts grew like an avalanche in his mind, weighing down his body.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet none of this inner turmoil showed on the outside. His face was as calm as a still sea, and his gaze was cold. Every night, he would go to the park, sitting in silence and staring into the darkness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, while sitting in the park, he felt someone pass behind him. When he turned around, he saw a shadow quickly slipping away. As he looked back, he noticed a black envelope beside him. He opened the envelope and found an address, signed with the initials "T.K." As dawn began to break, David got up and left. The address led him to the door of an abandoned factory. The door was closed, and no one was around. That night, instead of going to the park, he returned to the address.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was a few meters from the door, a figure dressed in black, reminiscent of a ninja, with his face covered, opened the door. David stepped inside quietly. The man moved ahead, and David followed him. The man in black bent down and opened a hatch. Beneath the hatch was a tunnel. They descended the stairs and passed through the tunnel, arriving at a place underground that resembled a military base, with several rooms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in black gestured and said,  
**"Go inside and wait."**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David entered. The room resembled the interrogation rooms seen in movies—just a table with a chair on each side. Twenty to thirty minutes later, the man in black returned, holding some papers. He placed the papers on the table and said,  
**"Read this information. After reading, you are free to leave whenever you wish. If you stay, Takeshi Kaga will come to speak with you in two hours."**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David pulled the papers closer and began to read. The first file contained information about his mother, father, and himself. Detailed descriptions of his father's job, who killed him, and how it all happened were written in detail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second file was about the killer: Derek Lawson, 38 years old, a drug-addicted drifter and murderer. David furrowed his brows and stared at the killer's picture for a few minutes, memorizing his facial features in case they ever met.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he picked up the last file. The cover read *"Dark Mist."* It contained only a brief description of an assassin's guild located in the mountains of Japan.

> "A dangerous organization that carries out assassinations for money. They have groups ready to act in every country at any time. To conceal their identities, assassins often lead normal lives by working regular jobs. They have families and friends, making them incredibly hard to track down. The most notorious of the exposed assassins is Emanuel Gonzales, who, unlike the others, does not hide."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David placed the files back on the table, stood up, and began pacing the room in deep thought. As he wandered, the door opened. A middle-aged Japanese man with sharp eyes entered the room. In a calm voice, he said,  
**"Hello, David. My name is Takeshi Kaga. I hope you haven't been bored. Please, sit. Let's talk a little."**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After both had sat down, Takeshi continued:

**Takeshi:** "I am sorry you lost your family at such a young age. I can imagine how difficult this is for you. I also lost my family when I was young. Now, I can't even remember them. But let's get to the point. What do you want, David? Why are you here?"

**David:** "You're the one who called me. Shouldn't I be asking that question?"

**Takeshi:** "Ah... No, no, David... Think carefully. Someone you’ve never seen leaves you a letter, and you decide to go to the address written inside. You wanted to come, David. So tell me, what do you want?"

**David:** "I don't know..."

**Takeshi:** "Those who do evil spread despair with their actions. Those who lose hope die in spirit. You want to regain your hope and breathe life back into your soul."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeshi stood up and said, **"Come with me."** They both exited and walked toward the door at the end of the corridor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeshi opened the door, and they entered. Inside, a man with tattered clothes lay on the ground. The man in black who greeted David upon his arrival entered and lifted the man. David recognized his face—it was Derek Lawson, his father's killer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeshi drew a knife from his belt, handed it to David, and said:  
**"Take this knife and avenge your father. Let your soul be reborn."**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David took the knife and stepped closer to the man.
